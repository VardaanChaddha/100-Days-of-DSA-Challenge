# 🚀 100 Days of DSA Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This is a log of my daily commitment to mastering problem-solving and foundational computer science concepts.

## 🎯 Objective
My goal is to code for at least an hour every day for 100 consecutive days, focusing entirely on Data Structures and Algorithms. By the end of this challenge, I aim to:
* Build a strong understanding of core algorithms (sorting, searching, graph traversal).
* Master fundamental data structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Hash Maps).
* Improve my problem-solving speed and write optimized, clean code.

## 💻 Languages Used
* C 

## 💡 Key Learnings
I will use this section to note down any "Aha!" moments, tricky concepts, or new syntax I discover along the way.
